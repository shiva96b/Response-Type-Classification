In this assignment, you will learn feature engineering through a classification task. Background Interactions through question-answering play an important role in discussions. Through questioning, askers may want to elicit information (e.g., wh-questions), clarify situations (e.g., closed-ended questions), or even make a point (e.g., rhetorical questions). However, how a question is responded does not necessarily align with the intent of the asker. For example, 

●	Asker: How could you possibly know that?

●	Responder: I am not claiming this is a statement of fact, it is an opinion.

In the example above, the asker implies a point “no one could know that” with a rhetorical question, however, though generally no response is expected for a rhetorical question, theresponder attacked the point the asker makes.

In this assignment, you will need to model the relations between a question and response and classify the interaction into different types.
