In this assignment, you will learn feature engineering through a classification task. Background Interactions through question-answering play an important role in discussions. Through questioning, askers may want to elicit information (e.g., wh-questions), clarify situations (e.g., closed-ended questions), or even make a point (e.g., rhetorical questions). However, how a question is responded does not necessarily align with the intent of the asker. For example, 

●	Asker: How could you possibly know that?
●	Responder: I am not claiming this is a statement of fact, it is an opinion.

In the example above, the asker implies a point “no one could know that” with a rhetorical question, however, though generally no response is expected for a rhetorical question, theresponder attacked the point the asker makes.

In this assignment, you will need to model the relations between a question and response and classify the interaction into different types.
 
*Run*

Run all the cells of the notebook in a google collab in the same order.
Please upload P1_training.xlsx and P1_testing.xlsx files in the begining when a prompt occurs.

Language: Python
Total run time: 10 mins (including loading libraries and pre trained models)

The code has been commented and well documented in the notebook itself.
The snippets of code haven't been included in the report because the general processes have been highlighted in the notebook itself.
